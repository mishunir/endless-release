Currently, the Bridge.sol contract does not have automated test coverage.  

Tasks:
- Write unit tests to verify the correctness of core contract functions.
- Test state variable initialization and updates.
- Include edge cases and failure scenarios.
- Ensure tests can run on a local testnet or using a framework like Hardhat or Truffle.

Benefits:
- Ensures the contract works as expected before deployment.
- Helps catch bugs early.
- Provides confidence for future updates and refactoring.
