The current README.md file does not provide clear instructions on how to use or deploy the Bridge.sol contract. 

Tasks:
- Add step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment.
- Include commands to compile and deploy the contract on local and testnet environments.
- Provide examples of interacting with the deployed contract.
- Add notes on required dependencies and configuration files.

Benefits:
- Helps new contributors get started quickly.
- Reduces confusion during deployment and testing.
- Improves overall project documentation quality.
